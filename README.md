Restaurant Management System (RMS) in Python
This repository contains a basic Python implementation of a Restaurant Management System (RMS). The rms class allows users to manage restaurant orders and customer interactions, with methods to:

Greet customers upon arrival.
Display a menu of available items.
Handle user orders and calculate bills.
Process customer payments and feedback.
This project is ideal for learning object-oriented programming concepts and implementing a simple command-line interface for restaurant management tasks.
